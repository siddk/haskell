Haskell
=======

Haskell is a functional programming language, one that is being widely adopted in Industry and in Academia, and it comes with a series of great libraries and modules for data analysis, parallel processing, and graphics. Having been exposed to Scheme, I decided to learn Haskell this summer for the purposes of furthering my education, and to gain a better appreciation for functional programming and its applications.
