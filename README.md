Haskell
=======

Haskell is a functional programming language, one that is being widely adopted in Industry and in Academia, and it comes with a series of great libraries and modules for data analysis, parallel processing, and graphics. Having been exposed to Scheme, I decided to learn Haskell this summer for the purposes of furthering my education, and to gain a better appreciation for functional programming and its applications.

The following make up a series of Haskell tutorials/projects I would like to complete by the end of August 2014.


- [ ] Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours
- [ ] Roll Your own IRC Bot
- [ ] How to Organize a Picnic on a Computer
- [ ] Learn You a Haskell for the Greater Good
- [ ] Parallel Processing with Haskell
- [ ] H-99: 99 Haskell Problems
- [ ] LISP in Haskell
